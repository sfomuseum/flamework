# The base set of sensible PHP options. You could put these in your
# php.ini file too, but having them in your Apache config puts
# everything in one place. Magic quotes off because they are stupid.
# Register globals off for the same reason. Track errors is so that
# we can at least get at the error messages we hide using @func().
# last_modified is a bad idea if we have any dynamic content. Short
# tags make for a few saved bytes of cruft and are fine unless you're
# running another XML preprocessor over your code (wtf?).

# this sets all current and future error flags on, except for E_NOTICE
